## Project Status
This project is currently a work in progress.

## Data Source
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidcariboo/player-scores
The source was obtained from Kaggle. We selected three Excel files: clubs.csv, players.csv, and player_valuations.csv for the project.

## Overview
Data Import: Utilized Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, sqlalchemy, pandasql to manipulate the data and import data from CSV files into the Python environment for further analysis.

Basic SELECT queries: Executed simple SQL SELECT queries to retrieve specific columns or rows from the dataset, providing an initial exploration of the data.
WHERE Clause: Employed the WHERE clause in SQL to filter rows from the dataset based on specified conditions, allowing for targeted analysis of relevant data subsets.

ORDER BY: By incorporating the ORDER BY clause, data was sorted based on specified columns, enhancing the readability and interpretability of analysis results.

GROUP BY: Utilized the GROUP BY clause in SQL to aggregate data based on specified columns, enabling the calculation of summary statistics or insights across different groups within the dataset.

HAVING Clause: Applied the HAVING clause in SQL to filter grouped data based on aggregate conditions, refining the analysis to include only groups that meet specific criteria.

LEFT JOIN:  Utilized SQL's LEFT JOIN operation to combine data from multiple tables based on a common key, facilitating the integration of information from different sources for comprehensive analysis.

Merge into Pandas: Leveraged the Pandas library in Python to merge datasets or perform similar operations, providing flexibility and control over the data manipulation process within the Python environment. This approach yielded results comparable to using SQL joins, ensuring seamless integration and analysis of disparate datasets.
